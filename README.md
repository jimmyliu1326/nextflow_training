# CIDGOH Nextflow Training

This repository serves as an archive for the training materials that were developed to acquaint new trainees with the fundamentals of Nextflow pipeline development.

**Topics covered:**

- Channels, proccesses and workflows
- Operators
- Running Nextflow pipelines via CLI
- Hierarchical structure of a typical Nextflow pipeline repo
- NF-CORE template

## Running the tutorial
This tutorial is powered by **GitHub Codespace** to provision a common environment for all trainees and others to follow along and collaborate. The environment is pre-installed with Nextflow, Conda and VSCode, providing the necessary means to test out example workflows, as well as the workflows developed by the trainees themselves.

Navigate to this link to launch the environment: https://github.com/codespaces/new/jimmyliu1326/nextflow_training?quickstart=1
